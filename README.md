Vault - a secure value storage (data-at-rest) implementation for Go.

## Scope

VaultStore is specifically designed as a data store component for securely storing and retrieving secrets. It is **not** an API or a complete secrets management system. Features such as user management, access control, and API endpoints are intentionally beyond the scope of this project.

VaultStore is meant to be integrated into your application as a library, providing the data storage layer for your secrets management needs. The application using VaultStore is responsible for implementing any additional layers such as API endpoints, user management, or access control if needed.

## Table Schema ##

The following schema is used for the database.

| vault       |                  |
|-------------|------------------|
| id          | String, UniqueId |
| vault_token | Long Text, Unique|
| vault_value | Long Text        |
| created_at  | DateTime         |
| updated_at  | DateTime         |
| soft_deleted_at | DateTime     |

## Setup

```golang
vault, err := NewStore(NewStoreOptions{
	VaultTableName:     "my_vault",
	DB:                 databaseInstance,
	AutomigrateEnabled: true,
})

```

## Usage

Here are some basic examples of using VaultStore. For comprehensive documentation, see the [Usage Guide](/docs/usage_guide.md).

```golang
// Create a token
token, err := vault.TokenCreate("my_value", "my_password", 20)

// Check if a token exists
exists, err := vault.TokenExists(token)

// Read a value using a token
value, err := vault.TokenRead(token, "my_password")

// Update a token's value
err := vault.TokenUpdate(token, "new_value", "my_password")

// Delete a token
err := vault.TokenDelete(token)

// Soft delete a token
err := vault.TokenSoftDelete(token)
```
