# API and Integration Improvements

## Overview

This proposal suggests enhancing the VaultStore API and adding integration capabilities to make it more versatile and easier to use with other systems.

## Current Implementation

Currently, VaultStore provides a Go API for storing and retrieving secrets. However, it lacks integration points with other systems and modern API patterns that would make it more versatile in diverse environments.

## Proposed Changes

1. **RESTful API**: Implement a RESTful HTTP API layer on top of VaultStore, allowing non-Go applications to interact with the vault.

2. **gRPC Support**: Add gRPC interfaces for high-performance, cross-language communication.

3. **Webhooks**: Implement webhook notifications for secret lifecycle events (creation, access, update, expiration).

4. **Cloud Provider Integrations**: Add integrations with major cloud providers' secret management services (AWS Secrets Manager, Google Secret Manager, Azure Key Vault).

5. **Kubernetes Integration**: Develop a Kubernetes operator for VaultStore to manage secrets in Kubernetes environments.

## Implementation Details

The implementation would require:

- Creating a new HTTP server package with RESTful endpoints
- Implementing gRPC service definitions and handlers
- Developing a webhook notification system
- Building cloud provider adapters
- Creating a Kubernetes operator

Example RESTful API endpoints:

```
POST   /api/v1/tokens          # Create a new token
GET    /api/v1/tokens/{token}  # Retrieve a token's value
PUT    /api/v1/tokens/{token}  # Update a token's value
DELETE /api/v1/tokens/{token}  # Delete a token
```

## Benefits

- **Broader Adoption**: Makes VaultStore accessible to applications written in any language
- **Ecosystem Integration**: Allows VaultStore to fit into existing infrastructure and workflows
- **Operational Visibility**: Webhooks provide real-time notifications for monitoring and automation
- **Cloud Compatibility**: Enables hybrid cloud scenarios with consistent secret management

## Risks and Mitigations

- **Security Surface**: More integration points mean more potential attack vectors. Mitigation: Comprehensive security review and testing.
- **Complexity**: Supporting multiple protocols increases codebase complexity. Mitigation: Clear separation of concerns in the architecture.
- **Maintenance Burden**: More features to maintain. Mitigation: Modular design allowing optional components.

## Effort Estimation

- Development: 3-4 weeks
- Testing: 2 weeks
- Documentation: 1 week

## Conclusion

Enhancing the API and adding integration capabilities would significantly increase the utility and adoption potential of VaultStore, making it a more versatile solution for secret management across diverse technology stacks and environments.
