# Audit Logging Functionality

## Overview

This proposal suggests implementing comprehensive audit logging for all operations performed on the VaultStore, providing a traceable history of secret access and modifications.

## Current Implementation

Currently, VaultStore does not include audit logging capabilities. While operations are performed successfully, there is no record of who accessed which secrets or when modifications occurred.

## Proposed Changes

1. **Audit Log Table**: Create a new table to store audit logs with fields for timestamp, operation type, token identifier (not the actual token), user identifier, and IP address.

2. **Context Enhancement**: Extend the context parameter in all methods to include user identity and request metadata.

3. **Logging Interface**: Implement a pluggable logging interface that allows different logging backends (database, file, external service).

4. **Log Rotation**: Add functionality to archive and rotate logs based on time or size.

5. **Log Querying**: Provide methods to query and filter audit logs for security analysis.

## Implementation Details

The implementation would require:

- Creating a new database table for audit logs
- Defining a logging interface and default implementations
- Modifying all store methods to record audit events
- Implementing log rotation and querying functionality

Example audit log entry structure:

```go
type AuditLogEntry struct {
    ID          string    // Unique identifier for the log entry
    Timestamp   time.Time // When the operation occurred
    Operation   string    // Type of operation (create, read, update, delete)
    TokenID     string    // Identifier for the token (not the actual token)
    UserID      string    // Identifier for the user who performed the operation
    IPAddress   string    // IP address from which the operation was performed
    Success     bool      // Whether the operation succeeded
    ErrorMessage string   // Error message if the operation failed
}
```

## Benefits

- **Compliance**: Meets regulatory requirements for audit trails in sensitive data handling
- **Security Incident Response**: Provides data for investigating security incidents
- **Access Tracking**: Allows monitoring of who is accessing which secrets and when
- **Anomaly Detection**: Enables detection of unusual access patterns that might indicate a breach

## Risks and Mitigations

- **Performance Impact**: Logging adds overhead to operations. Mitigation: Implement asynchronous logging for non-critical paths.
- **Storage Growth**: Logs can grow rapidly. Mitigation: Implement log rotation and archiving.
- **Sensitive Information**: Logs might contain sensitive context. Mitigation: Ensure logs never contain actual secret values or passwords.

## Effort Estimation

- Development: 2-3 weeks
- Testing: 1 week
- Documentation: 2-3 days

## Conclusion

Adding audit logging functionality would significantly enhance the security and compliance posture of VaultStore, making it suitable for environments with strict regulatory requirements and security policies.
