# Enhanced Encryption Proposal

## Overview

This proposal suggests enhancing the encryption mechanism used in VaultStore to improve security and flexibility.

## Current Implementation

Currently, VaultStore uses a password-based encryption mechanism defined in `encdec.go`. While functional, this approach has limitations in terms of security strength and flexibility.

## Proposed Changes

1. **Implement Industry-Standard Encryption**: Replace the current encryption with AES-256-GCM, which provides authenticated encryption with associated data (AEAD).

2. **Key Derivation Function**: Use Argon2id for key derivation from passwords, which is more resistant to both GPU and ASIC attacks compared to simpler methods.

3. **Salt Management**: Implement proper salt generation and storage for each secret, ensuring that even identical secrets with the same password have different encrypted representations.

4. **Encryption Versioning**: Add a version field to the encrypted data format to allow for future encryption algorithm updates without breaking existing data.

5. **Key Rotation Support**: Add functionality to re-encrypt all secrets with a new master key or algorithm.

## Implementation Details

The enhanced encryption would require:

- Adding new dependencies for cryptographic functions
- Modifying the database schema to store salt and encryption version
- Creating migration tools for existing data
- Updating the API to support key rotation

## Benefits

- Stronger security against various attack vectors
- Future-proofing through versioned encryption
- Compliance with modern security standards
- Support for key rotation, a critical security practice

## Risks and Mitigations

- **Data Migration**: Existing data needs to be migrated. Mitigation: Provide robust migration tools and documentation.
- **Performance Impact**: More secure encryption may be slower. Mitigation: Benchmark and optimize critical paths.
- **Complexity**: Increased complexity in the codebase. Mitigation: Thorough documentation and test coverage.

## Effort Estimation

- Development: 2-3 weeks
- Testing: 1-2 weeks
- Documentation: 3-5 days

## Conclusion

Enhancing the encryption mechanism would significantly improve the security posture of VaultStore, making it suitable for storing highly sensitive information in compliance with modern security standards.
