# VaultStore Improvement Proposals

*Last Updated: March 12, 2025*

This document provides an overview of all proposed improvements to the VaultStore implementation. Each proposal is evaluated based on its alignment with the core purpose of VaultStore as a data store component.

## Project Scope Clarification

VaultStore is specifically designed as a data store component for securely storing and retrieving secrets. It is **not** an API or a complete secrets management system. Features such as user management, access control, and API endpoints are intentionally beyond the scope of this project.

## Proposals Index

| Proposal | Description | Status | Reason |
|----------|-------------|--------|--------|
| [Enhanced Encryption](20250312_enhanced_encryption.md) | Improve the encryption mechanism with industry-standard algorithms and key management | Accepted | Core security improvement for data store |
| [Token Expiration](20250312_token_expiration.md) | Add functionality for tokens to automatically expire after a specified time period | Accepted | Enhances security of stored data |
| [Secret Versioning](20250312_secret_versioning.md) | Track changes to secrets with version history and rollback capabilities | Accepted | Improves data management capabilities |
| [Password Hashing and Rekeying](20250312_password_hashing_and_rekeying.md) | Implement password hashing for verification and enable bulk rekeying | Accepted | Enhances security and management of stored data |
| [Audit Logging](20250312_audit_logging.md) | Implement comprehensive audit logging for all operations | Rejected | Beyond scope - should be implemented at application level |
| [Access Control and Permissions](20250312_access_control.md) | Add role-based access control and fine-grained permissions | Rejected | Beyond scope - user management is not part of data store |
| [API and Integration](20250312_api_integration.md) | Enhance API capabilities and add integrations with other systems | Rejected | Beyond scope - VaultStore is not an API |

## Accepted Proposals

### Enhanced Encryption
Improving the encryption mechanism is directly relevant to the core functionality of securely storing data, which is the primary purpose of VaultStore.

### Token Expiration
Adding expiration to tokens enhances the security of the stored data and is within the scope of the data store functionality.

### Secret Versioning
Tracking changes to secrets and providing rollback capabilities improves the data management aspects of the store.

### Password Hashing and Rekeying
Implementing password hashing for verification and enabling bulk rekeying enhances the security and management of stored data.

## Rejected Proposals

### Audit Logging
While audit logging is valuable for security monitoring, it is beyond the scope of VaultStore as a data store component. Audit logging should be implemented at the application level that integrates VaultStore.

### Access Control and Permissions
User management, role-based access control, and permissions are beyond the scope of VaultStore. These features should be implemented in the application that uses VaultStore.

### API and Integration
VaultStore is designed as a data store component, not an API. API endpoints, RESTful interfaces, and integrations with other systems should be implemented in the application layer that uses VaultStore.

## Implementation Strategy

For the accepted proposals, a suggested implementation order based on foundational improvements would be:

1. Enhanced Encryption
2. Password Hashing and Rekeying
3. Token Expiration
4. Secret Versioning

This order prioritizes security fundamentals before adding more advanced features.
